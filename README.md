GitHub Repository Structure: Our project repository was hosted on GitHub, a web-based hosting service for version control, which has been an invaluable tool throughout the development of our recommender system.Our repository is organized into two main directories: models and notebooks.

Models: The models directory is home to our various recommender system model notebooks. Each notebook corresponds to a specific model, is named after it, and contains the complete code and documentation for the development, training, and evaluation of that model. The models developed include LSTUR, NAML, NRMS, NPA, a popularity-based model, and a random recommendation model. For instance, LSTUR.ipynb contains the implementation for the LSTUR model, NRMS.ipynb for the NRMS model, and so on. This structure ensured that every model had its own isolated environment, facilitating testing and comparisons among them.

Notebooks: The notebooks directory, on the other hand, contains other notebooks that were essential to the project. DALLE2_API.ipynb was used for interacting with the DALLE-2 API, while EDA.ipynb contains exploratory data analysis that we carried out on the data. The notebooks where ensembles were made, and the daytime context possibilities were explored are included as well.

Git Workflow: GitHub's Git version control was key to our project, enabling the use of a standard workflow with individual branches for tasks. Team members created new branches for tasks, preventing disruptions to the main codebase until a Pull Request (PR) was approved. PRs facilitated code reviews, maintaining our coding standards and quality. This approach kept the main branch stable and minimized conflicts. Overall, GitHub's branch-and-merge workflow provided a robust structure for collaboration, version control, and code review.

MIcrosoft News Dataset (MIND) is a large-scale dataset for news recommendation research. It was collected from anonymized behavior logs of Microsoft News website. The mission of MIND is to serve as a benchmark dataset for news recommendation and facilitate the research in news recommendation and recommender systems area.

MIND contains about 160k English news articles and more than 15 million impression logs generated by 1 million users. Every news article contains rich textual content including title, abstract, body, category and entities. Each impression log contains the click events, non-clicked events and historical news click behaviors of this user before this impression. To protect user privacy, each user was de-linked from the production system when securely hashed into an anonymized ID.
